      As a Senior Frontend Engineer at Rentoza, I
      oversaw the creation of sophisticated
      e-commerce applications in React,
      TypeScript, and Next.js. I streamlined
      processes, guided, and trained juniors, and
      integrated Amazon Web Services (AWS) and
      BigQuery to improve project scalability. My
      key contributions include automating product
      database transfers and pioneering thorough
      cross-platform testing and validation.
      Working with UX designers using Figma, I
      ensured high-quality, user-centric
      interfaces. Notably, I oversaw the
      introduction of a new storefront, designing
      its architecture and guiding the team to
      meet tight constraints, demonstrating my
      leadership and technical expertise.

     <p>
      At FuellTech Systems, I was trusted to
      create/design new web interfaces, layouts,
      and site designs for a variety of clients in
      addition to transforming legacy code into
      reusable code components. I've also built
      websites, portals, and large-scale web
      applications for both complex and simple
      projects, demonstrating the technology we
      employ to customers. I've also created demo
      websites for new clients. I worked on
      projects that required API interaction with
      various providers, cloud computing and
      automation, cloud programs and
      functionalities, and back-end integration.
      One of my tasks was to ensure the quality of
      produced websites, including the validation
      of pages and links.{" "}
